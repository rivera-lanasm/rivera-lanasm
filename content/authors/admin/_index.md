AI/ML directed automated systems are increasingly embedded in, reflective of, and consequential to the operation of social and political systems. 

On the one hand, this trend broadens the methods researchers can use to understand social trends with better granularity, high frequency, at at lower cost. 
On the other, researchers should be actively investigating the feedback loops between social and technical systems that, left unchecked, have been demonstrated to systematically produce negative and inequitable social outcomes. 

The aspects of these topics I pursue in this blog relate to NLP, political disinformation, and socio technical systems generally.
